      <h2>What is Adobe Photoshop?</h2>

      <p>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1987 by Thomas and John Knoll.
        Since then, the software has become the most used tool for professional digital art, especially in raster graphics editing.</p>

      <p>Photoshop uses a layer-based editing system that allows users to work on images non-destructively. This means that users can create and edit multiple layers of an image 
        without affecting the original image. This makes Photoshop a very powerful tool for editing and creating images, as it allows users to experiment with different edits without 
        having to worry about ruining the original image. Photoshop is used by a wide range of professionals, including photographers, graphic designers, web designers, and video editors. 
        It is also used by hobbyists and enthusiasts to edit and create their own images.</p>

        <img src="Adobe_Illustrator_CC_icon.svg.png" alt="Second Image" style="float: left; width: 200px; height: 200px;">
        <p>Adobe Illustrator is a powerful vector graphics editing software developed by Adobe Inc. It is widely used by designers, artists, and illustrators to create and manipulate vector-based artwork. Unlike raster graphics, which are made up of pixels and can lose quality when scaled, Illustrator uses mathematical equations to define shapes and lines, allowing for infinitely scalable and high-resolution designs. It offers a wide range of tools and features for creating illustrations, logos, icons, typography, and other complex graphic elements, making it a go-to choice for professionals in the graphic design and digital art industries.</p>

        <p>Adobe Illustrator's intuitive interface and comprehensive toolkit make it ideal for tasks such as logo design, poster creation, web graphics, and more. It supports both Mac and Windows platforms and allows users to export their projects in various formats, ensuring compatibility with different software and printing processes. Illustrator's versatility, precision, and extensive design capabilities have made it a standard tool for graphic designers and artists looking to bring their creative visions to life in a scalable and professional manner.</p>
