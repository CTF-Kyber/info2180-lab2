      <p>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc.</p> 
      <p>for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1987 by Thomas and John Knoll.</p> 
      <p>Since then, the software has become the most used tool for professional digital art, especially in raster graphics editing.</p>
      <p>Photoshop uses a layer-based editing system that allows users to work on images non-destructively.</p> 
      <p>This means that users can create and edit multiple layers of an image without affecting the original image.</p> 
      <p>This makes Photoshop a very powerful tool for editing and creating images, as it allows users to experiment</p> 
      <p>with different edits without having to worry about ruining the original image. Photoshop is used by a wide</p> 
      <p>range of professionals, including photographers, graphic designers, web designers, and video editors.</p> 
      <p>It is also used by hobbyists and enthusiasts to edit and create their own images.</p>
